# Data Types and expressions
## 3 Fundamental Constructs of Programming Languages
* Data 
* Expressions
* Control Flow

### Examples
#### Data
* int
* float
* double
* char
* string
* bool
* vector
* program defined classes

#### Expressions
* input/output expressions
* arithmetic expressions
* boolean expressions

#### Control Flow
* Sequential
* Branching (if, if-else, else, switch)
* Iterative (while, for)
* Function calls
* Exceptions

## Data Types in C++
C++ is strongly typed - each data must have a type.
Data is stored either as variables or constants
constants may be either built into the language
### int
  * Kind of data - integers numbers
  * inner representation - each int uses 4 bytes (32 bits)
  * fized size data - all are the same size
  * 4 billion different numbers can be represented, but really big numbers don't fit.
  * The number is converted to binary, and zeros are filled in the beginning to fill all 32 bits.
```
6 base 10 = 110 base 2
stored as:
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000110
for negatives, the zeros become 1
-6 base 10 stored as:
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010

```

### float
### double
### char
### string
### bool
